<p>Hello stranger, <br/><br/>
In a sentence: Welcome to my music database! <br/><br/>
All good songs and all good CDs need to be recorded down, so that one day, when you're feeling a tad reminiscent, you can check them
up and they will be here for your viewing, or rather listening, pleasure. <br/><br/>
This site aims to provide you with just that! In this site you can browse a database of songs and add on your own ones. 
You can also search for songs by a given artist or in a given album. <br/><br/>
Remember to be careful with your input! The system only accepts certain types of input!<br/><br/>
So feel free to browse the site and add in your favorite tunes!<br/><br/>
Check back often!<br/></p>
